I am currently a research fellow at the University of Melbourne, where I work with [Prof. Trevor Cohn](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tcohn/) and [Assoc Prof. Benjamin Rubinstein](https://www.bipr.net/) on issues around adversarial learning for NLP (understanding vulnerabilities of NLP systems, such as machine translation). Prior to this, I was a CSIRO Early Research Career (CERC) postdoctoral fellow at [CSIRO Data61](https://data61.csiro.au/), where I worked with [Dr. Cecile Paris](https://people.csiro.au/P/C/Cecile-Paris) and others on opinion mining in social media. I obtained PhD in Computer Science from [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx), under the supervision of [Assoc Prof. Jie Zhang](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/zhangj/), and a master degree from the [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.cas.cn/).

* My research interests lie in the general area of natural language processing, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity, particularly in developing explainable and robust models for various NLP tasks, such as text classification and machine translation. I am also interested in machine learning and deep learning techniques applied to those tasks, such as probabilistic graphical models (e.g., MRFs, VAEs, GANs, etc.).[[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9ZuvJaAAAAAJ&hl=en)]
